                <p>
                    In the 2017 elections for the Virginia House of Delegates, Democrats received >54% of the vote but only 49 or 50 seats (depending on the outcome of a recount).
                    Using a very simple algorithm based on the notion that people should live as near other people in their districts as possible, Democrats would hold about 53% of the power, assuming the number of votes for Democrats and Republicans in each precinct is kept the same as in the actual 2017 elections.

                <h2>1. A Very Brief Introduction to Districts and Gerrymandering</h2>
                
                <p>
                    In the U.S. House of Representatives and in many state houses, representatives are elected to represent people in districts, which are regions of roughly equal population size.
                    The use of districts implicitly endorses the idea of <em>locality</em> in representation: people that live near each other have common interests that that should be represented in a legislative body.
                    Generally speaking, district boundaries are governed by state law, which to varying degrees of vagueness seek to preserve the following properties:
                </p>
                
                <dl>
                    <dt>Balanced Populations</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Because each representative gets one vote, each district should contain the same number of people in order to preserve the principle of equal representation.
                        There are subtleties here: e.g., there are fewer <em>eligible voters</em> in districts containing more prisoners, non-citizens, and minors, giving each individual voter more power.
                    </dd>
                    
                    <dt>Contiguity</dt>
                    <dd>
                        You should be able to reach every part of a district without crossing through other districts.
                    </dd>
                    
                    <dt>Compactness</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Because the notion of a district is to represent people that live near each other, districts should be compact.
                        Intuitively, this should mean roughly that district boundaries are as circular as possible, and that elongation and wiggling lines are to be avoided.
                        However, here are infinitely many ways of defining compactness mathematically; see Algorithm 2 below for my attempt at a simple one.
                    </dd>
                    
                    <dt>Competitiveness (stupid)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        If you can only imagine a world that consists of Democrats and Republicans, you might come to the conclusion that, to be fair, you should draw district lines that result in competitive races between Democrats and Republicans.
                        This idea is idiotic if you are trying to build a system with locality.
                        It's also idiotic if you're not trying to build a system with locality.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                
                <p>
                    [There should be pretty graphics here illustrating all this stuff, obviously.]
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <b>Gerrymandering</b> is the act of drawing district lines to help a particular candidate or party, named after the salamander-like shape used to get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbridge_Gerry">Elbridge Gerry</a> elected in 1812.
                    Laws as written give plenty of leeway to draw the lines as you see fit&mdash;as long as districts contain the same number of people&mdash;so that majority party, sometimes in cahoots with specific incumbents of the minority party, can draw bizarre shapes.
                    In general, these shapes are not compact, but laws don't define what compact means.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    A simple example: let's say the state of Absurdistan contains 1000 people, all of whom can and do vote, divided into 10 districts.
                    Let's say 459 of them are Sneezes and 541 of the are Coughs.
                    If the district lines are cleverly drawn so that all 100 voters in District A belong to the Coughs, there are still 459 remaining Sneezes and only 441 remaining Coughs for the rest of the districts.
                    If the rest of the districts can be drawn according to those proportions, the Sneezes can win all nine remaining districts 51-49.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In other words, with only 45.9% of the vote, the Sneezes have managed to get 90% of the power.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Two Simple Districting Algorithms</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Should districting should be handled by an algorithm?
                    There's been vigorous debate on this; my personal take is that it should absolutely be done by an algorithm, one that's as simple as possible and takes nothing into account except where constituents live.
                    The goal is not to be perfect: the goal is to be so simple that it's hard to cheat and hard to accuse other people of cheating ("the elite technocrats think they can pull a fast one!").
                    There are decades of papers on this subject&mdash;both the political arguments and the algorithms themselves&mdash;which I'm just going to ignore for the moment.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Of the four criteria sometimes enshrined in law, contiguity is the easiest: we'll require our algorithm to generate contiguous districts.
                    Competitiveness, as eloquently argued above, is just an idiotic notion, so we'll throw it out.
                    That leaves balanced populations and compactness.
                    Rather than trying to chase them both&mdash;as most papers do&mdash;we'll just do one at a time.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But wait, you say, don't you need balanced populations to ensure equal representation?
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    To which I answer: while we're changing the law on districting, let's change congressional voting rules too.
                    Instead of representatives getting one vote each, let's give them one vote for each of their constituents.
                    The balance of power is thus determined by the total number of constituents in districts controlled by different parties, rather than simply the number of seats.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Agglomerate, Then Move Things Around</h3>
                
                Both algorithms follow the same basic procedure.
                We start with small geographic regions&mdash;for example, census tracts or voting precincts&mdash;each in its own district.
                We agglomerate small districts into larger ones until the desired number of districts has been reached, merging districts according to our criterion.
                Then, we move precincts between neighboring districts until we can't find any more improvements.
                
                In short:
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Start with one district for each sub-district region (e.g., precinct).</li>
                    <li>
                        Until the desired number of districts is reached, at each step merge two districts to produce the best value for some criterion.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Then, until no more improvements can be found, at each step move a precinct from its district to a neighboring district, choosing the move that results in the best improvement.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                
                This approach (a “greedy algorithm”) is not guaranteed to produce the best solution for our criterion, but it gives good-enough results to understand what's going on.
                And it's fast: using Python, a slow language, it takes just a few seconds to identify 100 districts from 2000+ precincts even with inefficient implementations of some of the steps.
                
                <h3>Algorithm 1: Balanced Population</h3>
                
                <p>
                    One measure of how equal the populations are is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">Shannon entropy</a>, or information entropy.
                    The key thing to know: the higher the Shannon entropy, the closer the populations are to being the same.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This algorithm tries to maximize Shannon entropy to ensure that districts contain approximately the same number of people.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Algorithm 2: Compact Districts</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Districts are, at essence, collections of people that live near each other.
                    Therefore, I use the mathematically simplest version of this notion I could come up with as a metric for compactness: add up the distance between all pairs of people that live in the same district.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    If voting precincts are the smallest population unit available, for simplicity we assume that everyone lives at the centroid (smack dab in the middle) of their precincts.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This algorithm tries to minimize the total distance between all pairs of people in the same district.

                <h2>3. The 2017 Virginia House of Delegates</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Let's do an experiment: try the algorithms on the state of Virginia, and use precinct-level voting data from the 2017 election for the House of Delegates
                </p>
                
                First up, this is what the current districts look like (the incorrect aspect ratio came with the source graphic), along with the (still pending) outcome of the election:
                
                <div class="fig">
                    <img width="768" src="figures/actual.png">
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    Note that the Democrats won 54% of the vote but will, at best, tie the Republicans in terms of power!
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Some amount of shift in power to the Republicans away from the statewide vote percentage is to be expected.
                    Since Democrats are more spatially clustered in cities, in effect they have gerrymandered themselves: they waste votes by winning some districts by large margins.
                </p>
                
                Here are the results of Algorithm 1:
                
                <div class="fig">
                    <img width="768" src="figures/algorithm1.png">
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    First up, notice how weird the districts are: when the algorithm only cares about a balanced population, it may go for very strange shapes.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Next, notice that under this districting the Republicans have won 52% of the power!
                    In other words, without even <em>trying</em> to gerrymander, the weirdness of the districts has biased the voting more badly than the actual districts do.
                    (I think it could have gone the other way, but perhaps there's some subtle effect of spatial clustering going on here.)
                </p>
                
                And Algorithm 2:
                
                <div class="fig">
                    <img width="768" src="figures/algorithm2.png">
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    Much prettier districts.
                    Although the Democrats only won 40 seats, if you adjust the value of their seats by the population of each district, they get 53% of the power, much closer to their statewide vote total.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    As expected, under Algorithm 1 the populations are pretty close to each other, and under Algorithm 2 the populations are divergent:
                </p>
                
                <div class="fig">
                    <img width="768" src="figures/population.png">
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    Conversely, the average distance between people within the district is lower on average for Algorithm 2, and also much more consistent:
                </p>
                
                <div class="fig">
                    <img width="768" src="figures/distance.png">
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    It's hard to tell what's going on with the difference in the balance of power without seeing the vote margins:
                </p>
                
                <div class="fig">
                    <img width="768" src="figures/fracwon_districts.png">
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    ...and the vote margins at the precinct level:
                </p>
                
                <div class="fig">
                    <img width="768" src="figures/fracwon_precincts.png">

                    It's hard to come up with an easy-to-understand algorithm that both balances the population and makes compact districts.
                    It's much easier to come up with compact districts with unequal populations

                    A good hybrid system between local winner-take-all districts and proportional representation: instead of 100 districts, have 25 districts.
                    Take the top 4 vote winners in each of those 25 districts.
                    Weight their vote by the percentage of votes they won times the number of people in their district.
